    Other nodes can become the parent of 0.
    (this can't happen since 0 is top root node and represet other
     nodes to be full when connected to it)
    This bug is occuring due to rank difference between other root nodes,
    if any root has higher rank than top and bottom root i.e. 0 and size*size-1,
    it can become the root of them.
